        All you **have** to learn _here_ is how to have fun. Just pretend you
        are a whisper floating across a mountain. You have to make almighty
        decisions when you’re the creator. There we are.


        ---


        > We’ll throw some old gray clouds in here just sneaking around and
        having fun. Only eight colors that you need. This is the fun part Put it
        in, leave it alone. Get away from those little Christmas tree things we
        used to make in school.


        ```

        code:
          an_object_key:
            options: {}
            another_thing:
              - an array item
              - another array item
        ```


        Take your time. Speed will come later. You can bend rivers. But when I
        get home, the only thing I have power over is the garbage. Let’s get
        wild today. If you don’t think every day is a good day - try missing a
        few. You’ll see. Play with the angles. We don’t have to be committed. We
        are just playing here.


        Another code block:


        ```

        <div>
          <h1>This is a test for HTML code blocks</h1>
          <p>A paragraph</p>
        </div>

        ```


        Mix your color marbly don’t mix it dead. Trees cover up a multitude of
        sins. The only prerequisite is that it makes you happy. If it makes you
        happy then it’s good. When you do it your way you can go anywhere you
        choose. We’ll have a super time. Don’t fiddle with it all day.

        We have all at one time or another mixed some mud. It’s beautiful - and
        we haven’t even done anything to it yet. Let’s make some happy little
        clouds in our world. Let your heart be your guide.


        We have a fantastic little sky! We’re trying to teach you a technique
        here and how to use it.
