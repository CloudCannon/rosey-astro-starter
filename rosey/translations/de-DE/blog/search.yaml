      content: After indexing, Pagefind adds a static search bundle to your built
        files, which exposes a JavaScript search API that can be used anywhere
        on your site. Pagefind also provides a prebuilt UI that can be used with
        no configuration. (You can see the prebuilt UI at the top of this page.)

      content: The goal of Pagefind is that websites with tens of thousands of pages
        should be searchable by someone in their browser, while consuming as
        little bandwidth as possible. Pagefind’s search index is split into
        chunks, so that searching in the browser _only_ ever ~~needs~~ to load a
        small subset of the search index. Pagefind can run a full-text search on
        a 10,000 page site with a total network payload under 300kB, including
        the Pagefind library itself. For most sites, this will be closer to
        100kB.
