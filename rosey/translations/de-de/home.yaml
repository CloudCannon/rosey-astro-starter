      Added: A starting point for developers looking to build a multilingual
      website with Astro and Rosey, using Bookshop's component-based approach to
      building and editing sites in CloudCannon. After a developer has set up
      the site, CloudCannon provides a user interface for non-technical editors
      to maintain the site's content and enter translations. Create your own
      copy, and start creating your own components to use in the CloudCannon
      CMS.
