    A starting point for developers looking to build a multilingual website with
    Astro and Rosey, using Bookshop components in CloudCannon. CloudCannon
    provides a UI for non-technical editors to enter translations. Create your
    own copy, and start creating your own components to use in the CloudCannon
    CMS.

        A demo site for the Rosey-CloudCannon Multilingual Connector for Astro.


        Control translations via a user friendly interface in CloudCannon.


        Testing translations after *separating* out the logic from the
        translations.


        Adding *another* paragraph for a little **Smartling** test. Adding this
        as well, after making this site part of a monorepo.


        More changes on the real staging branch.


        Lets just add one more, **Smartling** do yo thing.

        They say *everything* looks better with odd numbers of things. But
        sometimes I put even numbers—just to upset the critics.


        We're ***changing*** things.


        It's cold, but it's beautiful. Get tough with it, get strong. Brown is
        such a nice color.
