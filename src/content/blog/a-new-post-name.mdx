Today's such a wonderful day, let's just make a happy little painting. Maybe I'll have a bit mountain today. You can do anything that you believe you can do. Get it to where you want it, and leave it alone. That's the fun part of this whole technique.

Don't over do it -- be careful. Be careful. Always start with a clean brush in a light area and work outward. We planned this son-of-a-gun right from the beginning. People are so excited when they see this happen. Everybody will see nature through different eyes.
